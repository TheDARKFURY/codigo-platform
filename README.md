# Código Platform

## Introduction
Welcome to the Código Platform repository! [Código](https://codigo.ai) is a powerful developer tool designed to make your smart contract development process seamless and efficient. 

With Código, you can generate **production-ready**, **secure** smart contract boilerplate, client libraries, web-based documentation, and test case templates in mere **SECONDS**. Whether you're a seasoned blockchain developer or just starting your journey, Código is here to boost your productivity and help you build secure and robust blockchain applications.

:::note
Código is not use-case specific, so you can build any kind of dApp you want to. We're not about limits; we're all about possibilities.

## What You'll Find in This Repository

In this repository, you will discover two key components that empower developers to build on the Solana blockchain quickly and efficiently.

### 1. Código Web IDE - Instant Development

**web_ide** houses our web-based integrated development environment (IDE) designed to streamline your Solana development journey. With this web-based IDE, developers can start building on Solana right away without the need to install multiple command-line tools, including [Cargo CLI](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/index.html), [Solana CLI](https://docs.solana.com/cli/conventions), Node CLI, Git CLI, and [Código CLI](https://docs.codigo.ai/development-suite/codigo-cli).

### 2. Código Command-Line Interface (CLI) - Rapid Code Generation

**cli** is our command-line interface (CLI) that can be installed locally on your system. It provides a convenient way to generate smart contract boilerplate code, client libraries, web-based documentation, and test case templates for your Solana-based projects.

You can install Código CLI directly from [here](https://github.com/Codigo-io/platform/releases)

Using both the **web_ide** and **cli**, developers can build dApps with incredible speed and efficiency using [CIDL (Código Interface Description Language)](https://docs.codigo.ai/c%C3%B3digo-interface-description-language/what-is-the-cidl#what-is-the-c%C3%B3digo-interface-description-language). Simply define your smart contract interface using CIDL and run the command `codigo solana generate cidl.yaml`. In mere **SECONDS**, Código will generate production-ready, secure smart contract boilerplate, client libraries, web-based documentation, and test case templates for your project.

## Features
Código CLI offers a range of features that make it an indispensable tool for blockchain developers:

**Smart Contract Boilerplate Generation:** Código generates complete and secure smart contract boilerplate code, saving you hours of development time.

**Client Libraries:** Código automatically creates client libraries for various programming languages, ensuring interoperability and ease of integration.

**Web-Based Documentation:** Generate comprehensive web-based documentation for your smart contracts, making it easy for developers to understand and interact with your contracts.

**Test Case Templates:** Get a head start on testing your smart contracts with a substantial number of pre-defined test case templates.

**Lightning-Fast:** All these features are available to you in mere seconds, improving your development speed and efficiency.
